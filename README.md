# Assignment 4: Search Engine 

This is a longer group project! Here are the [Project Instructions](Project_Instructions.pdf).


**Objectives:**

* Work in a team using version control.
* Design a larger system, plan the implementation and submit multiple deliverables.
* Implement a search tree-based map.
* Implement a persistent data structure.


## Automatic Tests and Memory Tests
You need to describe test cases for:
- Tests for your AVL tree's function
- Tests for your AVL tree for memory leaks (don't forget to test the persistence functions)
- Tests for indexer
- Tests for the complete system
